<body>
	The way this program is structured is that the "HW01" class handles the main
	instance, delegating the bulk of the work to the "Grid" class. <br>
	This was done in order to separate the window from the grid/JPanel, as well
	as keep the code modularized for extensibility. <br><br>

	The "Grid" class handled creating objects from the "MyPolygon" class, all
	of the drawing and refreshing the window, as well as receiving inputs from
	the Panel classes.<br>
	It acted as the key player in the program, tying all classes together.<br><br>

	Next, "MyPolygon" was created as an abstract class to allow a single type of
	object to be used interchangeably between "MyRectangle" and "TessCircle".

	This allowed the efficient use of a single array, instead of two separate ones.
	This one array with the type "MyPolygon" could then represent either of the
	subclasses' shapes.<br><br>

	The button panels were separated into more important (MainPanel: initialization/closing)
	and less important (SizePanel: changing size/properties) actions of the objects to
	improve the user experience.<br><br>

	In addition, this program allows pausing of the gravity simulation as well as
	coloring the objects green as they reach the bottom.
